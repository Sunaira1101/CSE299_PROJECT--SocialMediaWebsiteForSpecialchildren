# CSE299_PROJECT
Social Media Website for Special Children

This project mainly aims to address and limit several challenges faced by parents of special children every day, such as parents of special children often feeling isolated and lacking access to a supportive community where they can connect with others who understand their unique challenges and experiences. Thus, we aimed to provide a friendly community where the parents can communicate with each other anytime and get support from each other.
This project employs JavaScript, React.js, CSS for Frontend, Node.js for Backend and MYSQL Workbench for the database.
