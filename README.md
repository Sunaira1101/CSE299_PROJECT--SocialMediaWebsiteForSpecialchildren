<h1 align="center"><b>Social Media Website For Special Children</b></h1>


This project mainly aims to address and limit several challenges faced by parents of special children every day, such as parents of special children often feeling isolated and lacking access to a supportive community where they can connect with others who understand their unique challenges and experiences. This platform will serve as a valuable resource hub, offering parents access to information, tools, and strategies to better support their childrenâ€™s development and well-being. Through features like discussion forums, curated content on various conditions and therapies, this project aimed to empower parents with knowledge and foster a sense of belonging. By connecting parents with similar experiences, we hoped to alleviate feelings of isolation and create a network of mutual support, ensuring that no parent has to navigate the journey of raising a special child alone. Thus, we aimed to provide a friendly community where the parents can communicate with each other anytime and get support from each other.

This project employs JavaScript, React.js, CSS for Frontend, Node.js for Backend and MYSQL Workbench for the database.
